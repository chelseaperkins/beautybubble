Granting Access
A service account doesn’t need to prompt a user for access because you have to set it up. Go to the Google Calendar  website.  
Find the Calendar Settings , then go to the Calendars tab,find the calendar you want to access and click on  “Shared: Edit settings”  
add the service account email address like you would a persons email address.      
This will give the service account the same access as if you where sharing it with any other user.
